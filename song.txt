I'll never let you see
The way my broken heart is hurting me
I've got my pride and
I know how to hide
All the sorrow and pain
I'll do my crying in the rain


If I wait for stormy skies
You won't know the rain from the tears in my eyes
You'll never know that
I still love you so
Only the heartaches remain
I'll do my crying in the rain
